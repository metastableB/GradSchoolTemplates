Templates for Resume and SoP for graduate school applications.

## Cloud Use: Overleaf

I mostly use these on overleaf. To do the same, just download this repository as a zipped folder and import it into a blank project in overleaf. Make sure to select the appropriate latex engine.

## Local Use

I've included appropriate make files to be used with `latexmk`. If you have `latexmk` installed, things should work out of the box.


## LaTeX Enginers

 -  SoP: `xelatex`
 -  Resume: `pdflatex`
