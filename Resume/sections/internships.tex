\begin{project}
  \title{Universal IoT Gateway with Disaster Resilient Communication Pathways}
  \supervisor{Advisors: Dr. Vishram Mishra \& Prof. Lim H Beng}
  \duration{Summer Internship '17}
  \location{{CSI, SUTD/NUS, Singapore}}
  \link{\href{https://dkdennis.xyz/projects/\#UIoTGateway}{[Report]}}
  \description{Developed a Universal IoT Gateway - a gateway that can interact with any IoT device, regardless of its manufacturer or communication protocol (BLE, Bluetooth, WiFi or ZigBee). Works on an ontology based kernel that understands device specific properties and communication atoms. Protocol agnostic communication allows the device to double as a disaster resilient communication pathway - a mesh network at the MAC layer.}

\begin{project}
  \title{Multi-node BFS for Map-Reduce on Hadoop}
  \supervisor{Advisor: Dr. Debajyoti Bera}
  \duration{Summer Internship '16}
  \location{IIIT Delhi}
  \link{\href{https://dkdennis.xyz/projects/\#MultiBFS}{[GitHub \& Report]}}
  \description{Explored a new Breadth First Search algorithm with multi-point initialization for efficiency on the distributed map-reduce framework}
\end{project}
\begin{project}
  \title{WITCH on A Board}
  \supervisor{Advisors: David Anders \& Tom King, Intel}
  \location{Google Summer of Code}
  \link{\href{https://dkdennis.xyz/projects/\#WITCH}{[GitHub]}}
  \description{Developed the first complete simulation of the Harwell WITCH, a dekatron based computer used at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment, Oxfordshire during early 1950s. Worked with the very few details of its working that had survived and was declassified recently. \textit{\cusemph{(Helped win \pounds 50,000 funding.)}}}
