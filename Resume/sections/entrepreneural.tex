  \description{Co-founded a start-up called Weave, that had a nice product on human body visualizations and virtual trial rooms for fashion e-commerce for marginalized weavers of India. Secured a few clients, and garnered interest from investors but could not crack product-market fit or unit economics. Realized that fundamental flaws in strategies were overlooked. We had made the classic mistake of running after products without going through customer development. }
